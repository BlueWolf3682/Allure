# some text

A rather unique HJSON mod created by Elixias. Features some things, some more things, and even things that explode in your face. (working on it)

Holy crap it's even used as the modding wiki's example.

Special thanks to Meep and others for handling the support for many things.

If you are here, you have found the incomplete and barely functional 7.0 port/0.8 alpha content overhaul. Much of the stuff here is unfinished.

All sounds are NOT mine, but were Freesound assets all using attribution-less licenses. Not because I don't wanna credit the authors, but because I continually forget to and don't want any trouble. 

**do NOT expect a functional mod yet. if you ask me to fix a bug, it will be ignored. This doesn't mean that bugs will go unfixed, but that I will address them on my own time.**
